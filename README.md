In this project, I created a shopping cart application for an online plant shop which offers a variety of house plants.

# The main feautures are:
React Components: Created functional React components using component composition and nesting.
State Management with Hooks: Implemented React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks.
Redux Integration: Integrated Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
Rendering Dynamic Data: Dynamically rendered data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. 
Handling Events and Conditional Rendering: Handled user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
